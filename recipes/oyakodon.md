# Oyakodon

A simple chicken and egg dish that's great for lunch or dinner. Only takes about as long to make as the rice takes to cook once you get the hang of it. 

Recipe taken from Adam Liaw's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScS3GUc38gU) on the recipe. 

Recipe makes enough for 1 person, but it's very easy to scale up to more people. 

## Ingredients

- 1/8 cup teriyaki sauce
- 1-2 chicken thighs, depending on size (skin on preferred)
