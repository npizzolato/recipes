# Japanese Curry (Anthony's Recipe)

Anthony Phan's recipe for Japanese Curry. 

Recipe makes about 4-5 servings

## Ingredients

- 2 Russet Potatos
- 2-3 Large Carrots
- 1/2 Onion
- 3 squares of roux (The cartons in each box of curries break into 4 cubes typically)
    - Preferred brand is Golden Curry
- 1 Carton of Chicken Broth - or about 2-3 lbs of meat of choice
- Tonkatsu sauce
    - Preferred brand is BullDog Tonkatsu Sauce

## Instructions

1. Peel veggies
2. Cut potatoes into 2x1 chucks (pretty large since they dissolve quite a bit)
3. Cut Carrots into 1-inch cubes (small enough to cook through)
4. Slice onions into desired form w/e really works
5. Put into pot and cover with chicken broth plus water or just water if using meat of choice
6. Simmer on low-medium heat until carrots are soft with fork test. Stirring periodically (this is to allow the potatoes to release starches)
7. Add roux and dissolve (I use about 2 cubes of hot roux and 1 cube of medium roux)
8. Add tonkatsu sauce to taste
9. Take off heat and allow to cool (this helps with starch development)
10. Reheat and serve

#### Notes

1. If you like your curry thinner you can add more water 
2. If using meat of choice cut into small bites to allow to cook through around the same time carrots are ready
3. Short grain rice is desirable for general texture/mouth feel
4. Before I add roux I typically chop it up so it dissolves a little more evenly
