# Tofu with Onion, Garlic, and Soy Sauce

A very simple tofu dish with common house-hold ingredients. Ready in just a few minutes. 

A good side dish for a larger meal, but I often eat it by itself for dinner. 

Taken from Adam Liaw, who has an online recipe [here](https://adamliaw.com/recipe/silken-tofu-with-onion-garlic-and-soy-sauce/).

## Ingredients

- 1 300g block of tofu
- 1 1/2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped 
    - I usually just use pre-minced garlic for convenience
- 1/2 small brown onion, finely diced
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
    - I usually just eyeball this. I want enough to flow over the tofu onto the plate.
- 1 green onion, thinly sliced

## Instructions

1. Turn the block of silken tofu out onto a plate, taking care not to break the block. If the tofu is set into the packet, it can help to run a sharp knife around the side. 
2. Heat a small saucepan or wok over low-medium heat, slightly heat the oil, then add the onion. Cook slowly for around 4-5 minutes, adding the garlic mid-way through. Stir occasionally until the garlic and onion are browned and very fragrant. 
3. Remove from the heat and stir through the soy sauce. Pour the mixture over the top of the tofu, scatter with spring onions and serve immediately.
