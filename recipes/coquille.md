# Coquille

A creamy scallop and mushroom dish. One of my favorite recipes. We eat this every Thanksgiving and Christmas. 

It's not hard to make but it does use a lot of pots and pans. 

## Ingredients

- 1 pound white mushrooms ; sliced
- 1 lemon
- 5 tablespoons butter
- 2 pounds scallops
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 1/2 teaspoon Dried thyme
- 2 bay leaf
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 3 tablespoons flour
- 1 cup light cream ; (or half and half)
- bread crumbs

## Instructions

1. Cook mushrooms in 2 tbsp butter, sprinkle with the juice of one lemon, and cook until golden brown.
2. Place scallops, wine, and seasonings in saucepan and cook for around 5-7 minutes until scallops are cooked through.
3. Drain, reserving 1 cup broth.
4. Make white sauce with 3 tbsp butter, the flour, broth, and cream.
    1. Start with the butter and broth on low heat.
    2. Mix a small amount of flour and cream together in a shaker. Shake vigorously. Pour slowly into the broth, mixing constantly. The flour/cream mixture should be smooth (no lumps).
    3. Repeat step (4b) until sauce achieves desired consistency. It should be decently thick - it will thin out when it cooks in the oven.
5. Add scallops and mushrooms to a serving dish. Pour sauce over top.
6. Make buttered bread crumbs by melting butter in a sauce pan and adding bread crumbs until they have the desired volume. Add to top of dish.
7. Bake in preheated oven on 400 degrees for 10-15 minutes, until browned.
