Brocolli in an oyster sauce that tastes very meaty. 

Recipe taken from Adam Ragusea's [Broccoli in garlic sauce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xt5zzI_3-VA&t=321s) recipe.

## Ingredients

- 1 medium-large crown of broccoli
- 4 garlic cloves
- 1 thumb ginger (about the same amount as the garlic)
- 1/2 fresh chili (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/4 cup light soy sauce
- 1-2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 dab of honey
- 2 teaspoons yellow mustard
- 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil
- cornstarch 
- pepper
- MSG
- vegetable oil
- sesame seeds (optional)
- white rice

## Instructions

1. Make the rice like normal. Do not salt or otherwise season the rice. The sauce will be the seasoning.
2. Peel and roughly chop the garlic and ginger. Roughly chop the chili. 
3. In a pan with a steamer inside, bring 1 cup of water to a boil. 
4. While waiting for the water to boil, cut the brocolli into florets. Aim for larger sized florets as they shrink slightly. 
5. Steam the brocolli for 3 minutes. While that's happening, prepare an ice bath and shock the brocolli after they've finished steaming. Save 1 cup of the water used to steam the brocolli. 
6. Clean the pan and then put back on medium heat. Add cooking oil (not sesame oil). 
7. Cook the garlic, ginger, and chili in the oil until soft and fragrant. 
8. Add in the cup of water, soy sauce, sugar, honey, mustard, oyster suace, sesame oil, onion powder, and fresh pepper. Simmer for several minutes.
9. Prepare a slurry of corn starch and water. While stirring, add the corn starch to the sauce until it reaches the desired consistency (thick). 
    - From this point on, be extra careful about burning the sauce. It's easier to burn while it's thicker. 
10. Taste the sauce and add MSG/pepper to taste. The sauce should be stronger than you want it, because it's the main thing that's going to flavor both the brocolli and the rice. 
11. Add the brocolli to the sauce and mix through. Add water as necessary if the sauce is too thick. 
12. Garnish with sesame seeds.
