## Ingredients

- Fresh garlic (3 cloves) 
- 1 medium yellow onion 
- Olive oil (extra virgin and non) 
- Crushed red pepper flakes (optional) 
- Tomato paste (1 small can or squeeze tube) 
- 2 x 28 ounce cans San Marzano tomatoes (look for D.O.P. certified - otherwise, try Muir Glen Organic) 
- Fresh basil (1-2 sprigs) 
- Unsalted butter 
- Kosher salt 
- Freshly ground pepper

## Instructions

1. Mince garlic and finely chop onion. Garlic extra fine.
2. Heat 1/4 cup olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Saute garlic in olive oil. Add red pepper flakes and dried oregano. Saute 1 minute or very fragrant. 
3. Add onion and cook. 
    - Also add any other chopped vegetables here, relative to how long they need to cook compared to the onions.
4. Add tomato paste. Mix in. Then add tomatoes. Crush tomatoes against the side of the pot until chunky. Add basil and mix in. Simmer over low heat partially covered for 1 hour. 
5. Remove basil. Add a few tablespoons unsalted butter. Salt and pepper to taste.
