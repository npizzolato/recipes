# Japanese Curry

A really hearty meal that only takes 20-30 minutes to make. Great for meal-prepping for the week. 

Recipe makes about 4-5 servings worth.

## Ingredients

- 3 chicken thighs
- 1 yukon gold potato
- 1 small-medium sweet onion
- 3 carrots
- 1 box Japanese Curry mix (I use Golden Curry)
- Salt, to taste
- Vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. Make rice normally, separately. 1/3 - 1/2 cup rice per person (or more to save).
1. Cut up chicken into bite-sized pieces. They will shrink slightly while cooking. 
2. On a separate cutting, cut up onion, potatoes, and carrots. 
3. Over medium heat, cook the chicken in vegetable oil. When it's nearly done, add the onions and continue cooking. Then add the potatoes and carrots. Add salt while everything is cooking. 
4. Continue cooking by following instructions on curry box. 

#### Notes

I've tried cooking this without the chicken and adding more carrots/potatoes, but I found the curry to be rather bland. I think the fat from the chicken thighs adds a lot to it. You could try using chicken stock alongside the water if you don't want to add actual meat, but I'd want to find something else to add if going vegetarian.
