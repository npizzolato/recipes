# Dad's Marinara Sauce

Marinara sauce recipe I got from my dad. 

We make the lobster tail version of this recipe for Christmas, and it gets a wonderful fishy flavor. 

## Ingredients

- 2 Cans of Tomato Puree
- Bay Leaves
- Dried Basil
- Dried Oregano
- Dried Parsley
- Olive Oil
- White Onion
- Garlic
- Grated Parmesan Cheese
- Salt
- Pepper
- Meat (Italian Sausage, Meatballs, Spare Ribs) or Lobster Tails (optional)

## Instructions

1. In a deep, medium size sauce pan, cover the bottom with Olive Oil and add 1/2 chopped onion and 4 teaspoons of garlic (I use minced garlic for ease). Place over low heat until oil heats up and onion softens. Don’t let the garlic brown.
2. Add 2 cans of Tomato Puree cover and cook over low heat, stirring frequently. Continue cooking and stirring until the Puree is good and hot, then proceed.
3. Add Salt and Pepper, sparingly at first. You will add more “to taste” as the gravy cooks.
4. For every can of Puree used add 3 Bay Leaves to the gravy
5. Add the following spices. The amount of spice used should be equivalent to covering the entire top of the puree. If you used more than 2 cans of Puree add additional amounts of spices. (i.e. if used 4 cans of puree add the following spices twice)
	1. Dried Basil (stir into the Puree)
	2. Dried Oregano (stir into Puree)
	3. Dried Parsley (stir into Puree)
6. Add Parmesan Cheese. Cover about half of the top of the puree. If more than 2 cans of Puree were used add additional amounts of cheese. 
7. Reduce the heat to very low. Stir frequently because the tomato puree will burn on the bottom of the sauce pan if the heat is too high.
8. Cook on very low heat for 3-4 hours. Taste the gravy and add more spices to taste.
9. If you are adding Italian Sausage, Meatballs or Spare Ribs you want to partially cook the meat while the gravy is cooking. Stab the Italian Sausage before cooking. Place the meat on a greased (aluminum covered) cookie sheet and cook in the oven at 350 degrees. You want to partially cook the meat letting the fat drain out. The meat will continue to cook once it is placed in the gravy.
10. If you are adding Lobster Tails do not pre-cook the tails. However, you do want to cut the thin side of the shells with a scissor so that the lobster meat can be easily taken out of the shells when removed from the gravy.
11. Add the meat or Lobster Tails to the gravy and continue cooking. The longer you let the gravy simmer with the meat or Lobster Tails added in, the tastier the gravy will be. 
12. If the gravy is getting too thick feel free to add water. There is no correct thickness the gravy has to be. It’s just a matter of preference.
13. You cannot over cook the gravy just always keep the heat low.
