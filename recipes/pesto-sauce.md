# Pesto Sauce

Pesto recipe taken from [Kenji's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsppymX5k60).  

## Ingredients

- 2 oz Fresh Basil
- 2 tbsp Pine Nuts
- 2 Garlic Cloves
- 1 oz Parmesian Cheese, shredded
- Extra Virgin Olive Oil
- 1/2 tsp K osher Salt

## Instructions

You can make the sauce one of two ways - either in a food processor or in a mortar and pestle. 

### Food Processor

1. Add all ingredients minus the olive oil into the food processor. Mix until it's relatively fine and forms somewhat of a paste. 
2. Start adding olive oil, either drizzle in or half at a time. Continue mixing. 

### Mortar and Pestle

1. Start with garlic, pine nuts, and half the salt. Mix until it forms a paste. Start with smashing and then start doing a circular grinding motion. 
2. Add basil and continue mixing. Add a little bit of basil at a time. 
3. Add the rest of the salt and the cheese. Continue mixing. 
4. Start adding a bit of oil at a time, grinding in a circular motion to emulsify. 

### Serving

1. Served best over gnocchi. Add a few teaspoons of the pesto sauce and a little bit of pasta water to help bind the sauce to the pasta. Use the pasta water sparringly - don't make it into a soup.
