# Octopus

Octopus my family makes during Christmas.

## Ingredients

- 16 pounds of octopus
    - The rest of the ingredient amounts are based on this. Reduce if needed.
- 1 cup italian parsley, chopped
- lots of lemons
- olive oil
- 2-3 cloves of garlic

## Instructions

1. Defrost the octopus in the sink if frozen. Place it into a large bowl.
2. Use a knife or scissor to remove the black eye from teh center of the octopus if it's in there.
3. Place octopus into 1-2 large pots, filled with water. Cover and bring to a boil. 
    - At the time notes were taken, they did not rub salt into the octopus because it didn't feel slimy enough to need it. 
4. Once boiling, reduce heat to simmer and cook at least 1 hour. Begin tasting after 45 minute to 1 hour.
5. Remove from the pot and let cool. 
6. Chop octopus into bite-sized pieces. You can remove the fatty chunks.
7. Cover the octopus with lemon juice and a generous amount of olive oil. Mix together.
8. Add salt, pepper, parsley, and garlic. Mix together.
9. Balance the flavors. If there's too much lemon flavor, add more oil, and vice versa. Keep adjusting to taste. It will continue to taste off. It will soak up the lemon and oil overnight and taste different after. You can adjust for flavor the next day.
10. Chill overnight and rebalance the flavors the next day.
    - Ex. The next day it didn't ahve much flavor. We added another lemon, salt, and garlic until it tasted good.
