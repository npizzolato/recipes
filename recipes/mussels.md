# Mussels

Steamed mussels that Joey makes during Christmas and Thanksgiving.

The exact amount of everything depends on the pot you make it in. It doesn't use a lot of specific measurements. 

## Ingredients

- 2 pounds mussels
- white wine (doesn't really matter which, but Pinot is preferred. Chardonnay has a little too much alcohol flavor).
- 2 shallots, diced 
- a ton of garlic (4 teapoons?)
- 2-3 lemons
- 5 tablespoons butter
- enough red pepper flakes to lightly coat the top of the pan. Don't go crazy.

## Instructions

1. Prep non-mussel ingredients in a large pot. 
    - You want about a knuckle's worth of liquid at the bottom of the pot. 
    - When you put your face in the pot, you should smell the lemon and the garlic. If you smell more wine, you need more lemon. 
2. Clean mussels by running them under cold water and debeard them. Any open mussels are already dead and should be thrown away. Add to pot.
3. Cook covered for a few minutes (~5-10?). Enough for the mussels to open up.
